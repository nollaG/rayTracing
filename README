This is a program to implement raytracing algorithm.
Just my Computer Graphyics Course Project

Usage:
Just type make and enjoy it.

You can use defines to config the program.

There are several defines:
MULTITHREAD : use pthread to make this multithread
BUNNY : use a bunny to replace one ball
MULTIRAY : to trace multi ray in one pixel
ONELIGHT : turn off one light(there are two lights by default)

example:
make DEFINES="-DMULTITHREAD -DBUNNY -DMULTIRAY"
